# E-commerce User Table Update - Complete ✅

## Task Completed Successfully!

The `ecommerce_user` table has been successfully updated to contain only one user named "admin" with password "admin123".

## What Was Done:

### 1. ✅ Removed All Non-Admin Users
- Deleted 3 regular users: john_doe, jane_smith, bob_wilson
- Cleaned up all their associated orders and order items
- Maintained referential integrity

### 2. ✅ Updated Admin User Credentials
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123` (properly hashed)
- **Email**: `admin@ecommerce.com`
- **Permissions**: Staff and Superuser privileges

### 3. ✅ Database State After Update
```
Current ecommerce_user table:
+----+----------+-------------------+-------------------+----------+--------------+
| id | username | email             | password          | is_staff | is_superuser |
+----+----------+-------------------+-------------------+----------+--------------+
| 1  | admin    | admin@ecommerce.com| [hashed password] | true     | true         |
+----+----------+-------------------+-------------------+----------+--------------+
Total records: 1
```

## Login Credentials:

### For Django Admin Interface:
- **URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
- **Username/Email**: `admin@ecommerce.com` (our custom user model uses email for login)
- **Password**: `admin123`

### Alternative Login:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Note**: Direct password authentication works, Django admin uses email

## Verification Results:

✅ **User Exists**: Admin user found in database  
✅ **Credentials Valid**: Password "admin123" verified  
✅ **Permissions Set**: Staff and Superuser privileges active  
✅ **Database Clean**: Only 1 user remains in ecommerce_user table  
✅ **Login Tested**: Authentication successful  

## Database Impact:

- **Users Removed**: 3 (john_doe, jane_smith, bob_wilson)
- **Orders Removed**: 3 (all orders from deleted users)
- **Order Items Removed**: 6 (all related order items)
- **Users Remaining**: 1 (admin only)
- **Data Integrity**: Maintained (no orphaned records)

## Important Notes:

1. **Custom User Model**: The system uses a custom User model with email as the primary identifier
2. **Password Security**: Password is properly hashed using Django's security system
3. **Admin Access**: Full administrative privileges for managing products, orders, etc.
4. **Clean State**: Database is now in a clean state with only essential admin user

## Files Created/Updated:

- `cleanup_users.py` - Script to remove non-admin users
- `verify_admin.py` - Script to verify admin user setup
- Updated database with single admin user

## Ready for Use:

The e-commerce database is now ready with a clean user table containing only the admin user with the specified credentials. You can:

1. **Access Admin Panel**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. **Login**: admin@ecommerce.com / admin123
3. **Manage Data**: Full access to users, products, orders
4. **Add New Users**: Through admin interface or programmatically
